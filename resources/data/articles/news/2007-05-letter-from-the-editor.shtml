<p>When Ken Miller was nice enough to forward my email to Brad Pickering about the idea of an interview focused on the original Battlezone, I decided that another issue of this magazine was necessary. I mean, how often does somebody get to interview one of the creators of his favorite game AND then get the chance to talk to another?</p>
<p>Because of Mr. Pickering’s generous allotment of his important time, this issue of Battlezone magazine is focused completely on the original Battlezone. Pictures, stories, and so forth focus on this aspect of the game.</p>
<p>This will also start a trend. Instead of each magazine a throw together of anything I can get my hands on, I’m going to make it focused on a certain aspect of the game. At least it’ll keep me from using up all my resources to quickly.</p>
<p>So, enjoy this episode and look for the next one coming soon!</p>
