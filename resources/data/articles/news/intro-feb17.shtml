<p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the second issue of the Battlezone Field Report. We hope you've all had a fantastic Christmas and New Year, and we're kicking off 2017 with a bumper issue. This time around we're bringing you an exclusive interview with Team Evolve's Robert Waring, the second part of Bobcat Betty's combat guide and our New Year workshop run-down. In this issue we'll also be providing a run-down of the changes introduced in the latest patch.</p>
<p>The Heracles Brigade is busy with a lot of big projects we hope to share soon.  To tide you over we're also publishing 'The Battlezone Chronicles', a long-running alternative-universe serial run by HyperFighter with chapters contributed by many other community members.</p>
<p>We've also created a community discord server which you can access from this site's primary navigation menu or by clicking <a href="/page/discord" alt="Battlezone Community Discord">here</a>.  The server is available for members of the Battlezone 1998, Battlezone II, Battlezone 98 Redux, and any other related community.  We're working on bots and systems to make it a powerful utility for anyone looking to play the game or be involved in the community.</p>
