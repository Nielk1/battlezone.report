<p>Some of you maybe thinking, “What the heck is this?”. This is my attempt at bringing together all the information around the Battlezone II world and creating a community Magazine that people can read. In essence, getting Battlezone II its very own Fan-zine.</p>
<p>The idea first started three months ago when I was reading an online E-zine and it made me think, “Why don’t I put together a magazine that has updates on the mods so people can have a monthly update on their favorite game?”</p>
<p>That “I” turned in to a “we” very quickly as I began asking around on everybody’s idea of the project and for submissions. I began also adding more in to the magazine like interviews, stories, tutorials, information, etc.</p>
<p>The major breakthrough that really got me going was the interview. I took a long shot and emailed Ken Miller seeing he would be interested in an interview. He said yes and the rest just fell in to place. Wug was kind enough to pen out a Tutorial, A story I liked a lot was picked for the story of the month, and slowly things fell in to place.</p>
<p>So, what I have here to present you is a compilation of everybody’s hard work in one location in the hopes that this will be something that the Battlezone I & II community will like.</p>
<p>If all of you really like this idea and want to see another issue, then the team will begin putting a new one together. If not, then this will be the only issue ever created.</p>
<p>We hope that you enjoy this read!</p>
