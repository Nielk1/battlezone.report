<p>This is INN anchor Bobby Tiberius giving you the up to date new of space and space affairs.</p>
<p>It has been a couple of weeks since the Grand Admiral gave hi address at Red Palace. Seemingly keeping to his word, the Gran Admiral has approved a number of operations set to develop the plane Venus. Within these last few weeks, hundreds of tons of Imperiu hardware and supplies have been shipped to the planet in what can b described as the biggest construction project attempted since th GOLEM Empire's "Constructor Raep Cannon", back in 2009 Forces of the Venusian 1st Army under General Rostislav hav mobilized large numbers of men and personnel to oversee the project' completion.</p>
<p>We now bring you to anchorwoman Jane Robinson live from Navk Planitia, Venus. What's going on over there Jane?</p>
<p>"Bobby, the environment is hostile. You can barely see 15 meters in front of you, and the atmosphere looks ominous. However even in these conditions Imperium troops continue to work nonstop Over here we have construction of a major roadway. The current plan have the roadway serve as a connecting path between the Beta Regi region of north-western Venus and the Ovda Regio region o south-central Venus. According to some of the officers here, roadway like these are being set up all throughout the planet. This is wha they are calling Phase One of the project. When the roadways ar completed, they can begin to use a few launchpads to send th majority of the goods to the planet, and then ship them off to th necessary areas via these supply routes. Back to you Bobby."</p>
<p>Thanks Jane. In other news we have seen slight mobilization fro the Martian 3rd Army this week in preparation for an invasion  fortified hill in the Rockslide region of Charitum Montes near th Southern Pole. Forces under control of the "Cothonian" hav taken a position near the summit of a steep peak that has rendere the position well fortified. According to reports from High Command the enemy has held that position for a few months, yet is cut off b blockade. It is suggested that the forces in the area are heavil under-supplied, and the only thing preventing a walk-over is th easily defended terrain. General Thompson claims that the operatio will begin by next month and that the full cleanup operation shoul take roughly a week.</p>
<p>This has been INN news with Bobby Tiberius. We now return you t your regularly unscheduled programming.</p>
