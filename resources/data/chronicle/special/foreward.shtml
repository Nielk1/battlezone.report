<p>Introducing the Battlezone Chronicles, a series of short stories set in an alternate Battlezone universe in which the destruction of Achilles was never quite total, in which the fragile NSDF/CCA alliance was never given the opportunity to strengthen and fractured into dozens of separate components, in which the survivors of the Biometal War were abandoned and forgotten by the people of earth and left to fend for themselves in the vast open solar system. As the decades passed, those that survived began to slowly but surely return to Earth to recruit those interested in a new life in space for protection and additional skill to eke out a living in space.</p>
