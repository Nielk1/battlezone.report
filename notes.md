Symptom: Vite manifest not found
Meaning: This error means Vite hasnâ€™t built your frontend assets yet or the vite configuration was updated, so the manifest file (`public/build/manifest.json`) is missing.
Fix:
    1. Install dependencies (if not done yet): `npm install`
    2. Build assets for development: `npm run dev`
       * Or for production: `npm run build`

create controller `php artisan make:controller MyController`
create view `php artisan make:view viewname`
